<h4><strong>Docker Desktop for Windows Terminals</strong></h4><p>On Windows you'll likely want to use PowerShell terminal (PowerShell.exe) rather than Command Prompt (cmd.exe), but if you don't like the default GUI window that Microsoft provides, you might want to check out <a href="http://cmder.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cmder</a>, which can run PowerShell inside a fancy tab-based GUI with lots of features. You can also use Bash shells but you're on your own for setting those up.</p><p><br></p><h4>Windows PowerShell Tab Completion</h4><p>Tab completion lets you quickly fill the rest of a command or argument as you type by hitting Tab. To get "tab completion" in PowerShell, <a href="https://github.com/matt9ucci/DockerCompletion" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">try the setup steps for "DockerCompletion" on GitHub</a>.</p><p><br></p><h4><strong>macOS Terminals</strong></h4><p>On Mac you can use the built in Terminal program which uses the default Bash shell. I prefer to use <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">iTerm</a> as my GUI terminal interface to gain more features than the built in one. </p><h4>macOS Bash Tab Completion</h4><p>Tab completion lets you quickly fill the rest of a command or argument as you type by hitting Tab. Assuming you're running Docker for Mac, you'll want to connect up the completion scripts that come with Docker for Mac to your shell. <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#install-shell-completion" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Docker talks about this in their docs</a>.  1. install docker 2. install completion with brew 3. update your .bash_profile 4. symlink your docker completion files 5. restart your terminal.</p><p><br></p><h4><strong>Linux</strong></h4><p>In a desktop Linux distro like Ubuntu, Mint, etc. you'll likely need to do nothing. They already have good built-in terminals and Bash tab completion works out of the box. Happy days!</p>
