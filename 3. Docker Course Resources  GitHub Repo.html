<p>All examples and assignment files are in a <a href="https://github.com/anshulc55/Docker_for_DevOps" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">single code repository on GitHub</a>. Each folder represents a single Section video (but not all lectures have a folder, as not all need code). </p><p><strong>You should clone this repo</strong> into your user profile somewhere on your host. (<code>c:/Users/username/</code>  on Windows and <code>/Users/username</code>  on Mac/Linux). Having inside your user profile will ensure Docker works correctly on Mac and Windows. The location doesn't matter for Linux hosts. <code>git clone https://github.com/anshulc55/Docker_for_DevOps.git </code><br></p><p>If you're rather new to GitHub, you can download the GUI to make it very easy to push/pull code at <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://desktop.github.com/</a> for Mac and Windows. A great alternative Git client is <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.gitkraken.com/</a>.</p><p>We won't use git much in this course but <a href="https://try.github.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">knowing the basics</a> of pulling code, committing code, and pushing updates could be helpful at times in the course.</p>
